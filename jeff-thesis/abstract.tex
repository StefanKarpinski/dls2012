Dynamic programming languages have become popular for scientific
computing. They are generally considered highly productive, but lacking in
performance. This thesis presents a new dynamic language for technical
computing, designed for performance from the beginning by adapting and
extending modern programming language techniques. A design
based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables
an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading
to good performance for a wide range of programs.
In our system, more behavior can be defined in libraries and user code,
allowing our infrastructure to be shared across disciplines.
